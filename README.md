DISCLAIMER:
None of the designs in this repo have been tested or certified to any safety standards (IEC 60601-1, UL-94, etc). 
Intended for non-clinical, research use only.
Circuits may involve hazardous voltages, currents, and temperatures.
For non-expert users, I highly recommend never touching the circuitry while power is being applied. Circuitry may be probed, but probes should not be moved or tampered with while power is applied.
